This is a rule-based chatbot built in Python (e.g., Omah Dental). 
The chatbot: Greets the user and asks for their name.
-Offers a menu of services  for example:working hours, location, services, etc...
-Uses keyword detection to respond to user queries.
-Handles unknown questions with a default message.
-Responds politely to "thank you" messages.
-Users exit the conversation by typing "exit", "quit", or "bye".
-Supports typing 'services' to display the options again at any time.

How to run this code:
Step 1: Simple install python3 on your machine(no external libraies are required).
Step 2:Save the code using .py extension(ex: mychatbot.py).
Step 3:Open a command prompt or Terminal.
Step 4:Navigate to the folder where the script is saved.
Step 5:Run the chatbot using: python mychatbot.py

Challenges faced:
As a beginner in Python, building this chatbot was a bit challenging at first. 
I started by using basic Python functions and gradually developed the chatbot structure step by step. 
Once I wrote the initial structure, it became easier to add features like user input handling and responses. 
I learned that Python is case-sensitive, which means "Exit" and "exit" are treated differentlyâ€”so 
I used the .lower() method to normalize all input, making it easier to compare user responses.
I also learned the importance of proper indentation, since Python uses indentation to define code blocks. 
Making sure indentation was consistent helped me avoid syntax errors and improved readability.
Overall, this was a great learning experience that helped me apply basic Python concepts to a real-world task.
